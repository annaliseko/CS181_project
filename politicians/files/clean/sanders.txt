today: strengthen obamacare and stop the repeal. tomorrow, we must join the rest of the world and guarantee health care for all.if you're rich and powerful and commit illegal behavior you get promoted to the president's cabinet. thereâ€™s something very wrong with that.our nation worships wealth rather than caring for the poor. i donâ€™t believe that is the nation we should be living

should be encouraging our people to get the best education they can, not punishing them with a mountain of debt.if we are serious about having the best-educated workforce in the world, we have got to make public colleges and universities tuition-free.it is unconscionable that millions of people in the worldâ€™s richest country are one diagnosis or car accident away from financial disaster.we will lose our fights for justice when we are divided or apathetic, and the fights coming this year are far too important to risk that.rt @maddow: back on the air tonight after a little holiday break -- big live interview tonight with senator @berniesanders pm et, msnbccongress has got to protect and expand the health care needs of working families, not cut them.stopping the republican assault on the working class will require the active participation of millions of americans in every community.the struggle for our rights is not a one-time event. it must be fought by every generation.we wonâ€™t let republicans punish the elderly, children, sick and poor while they reward their billionaire friends. we've seen the surefire route to success in politics has been to manipulate people's fear and ignorance. we can and will change that.we are living in a nation which worships wealth rather than caring for the poor. i don't think that is the nation we should be living in.working people are angry and they have a right to be angry. this economy isnâ€™t for themâ€”itâ€™s for the extremely wealthy.republicans are not going to get away with punishing the poor while rewarding their billionaire friends.when we fight weâ€™re fighting for the futureâ€”the future of the planet in terms of climate change, and for the future of american democracy.happy new year! never forget greed is powerful but our vision of a world based on economic, social &amp; environmental justice is more powerful.fossil fuel companies are willing to destroy the planet for short-term profits. that is just incomprehensible. incomprehensible.the pharmaceutical industry is the most profitable industry in the country. that should not be the case when peopleâ€™s lives are at stake.republicans claim to represent family values but plan to throw  million people off health insurance. that doesn't seem like family values.cities and towns and states have stepped up and raised the minimum wage to $. itâ€™s about time that congress does the same for all workers.you cannot be a party which takes money from wall street and then tells working families you are on their side. people see through that.the u.s. shouldnâ€™t discourage kids who want to go to college with massive costs. we should be educating as many people as we possibly can.our goal must be to improve the va, not destroy it. we will vigorously oppose any and all efforts to privatize the va.while other nations are guaranteeing health care as a right, we spend more on our military than the next seven nations combined.i wish elected officials would spend less time making it harder for people to vote and more time fighting for the working class.members of congress spend way too much time in pursuit of money and too little time actually debating the issues.here's a radical idea.  let's create an economy that works for the bottom %, not just the people on top.my nightmare is our grandchildren wondering why we did not leave them a planet that is habitable. states and cities raised minimum wages this year. how is that possible? because millions of people stood up to fight.it doesn't make sense to trust billionaires to fight for the working class. the billionaire agenda is not the agenda of the american people.if we claim to be the greatest nation on earth, then we've got to catch up to other major countries and guarantee health care for all.the epa needs a leader who will actually protect the environment, not a climate denier like trump's choice scott pruitt.rt @chicagotribune: bernie sanders, top democrats call for "day of action" to oppose health care cuts under trump  hâ€¦we have accomplished too much as a country to see our progress washed away by leaders who are fearful, hateful and misinformed.it really is frightening when you have a party controlling the house, senate and presidency and saying "you know what? we reject science."one of the most revolting aspects of the student loan crisis is that the government makes billions in profits off of student loans.a $ minimum wage was very recently considered too radical. but when people see the justice of an idea, it catches fire very quickly.it's an international embarrassment that we imprison more people than any other country on earth.people should not have to choose between medicine and groceries. and yet the greed of the drug industry makes that happen every day."people who want to limit carbon emissions:âœ… majority of democratsâœ… majority of republicansâŒ trump's choice for epa head"our priority now is to transform our energy system to renewables, not empower fossil fuel ceos like mr. trump is doing.people are frustrated because in the last few decades, the wealthy have seen their incomes rise immensely while theâ€¦ trump's cabinet, the wealthiest in history, is worth more than the annual gdp of  countries. so much for draining the swamp...mr. trump and his friends should know there are millions of people who will not stand for their greed at the expense of the working class.while tens of millions of children around the world go hungry and uneducated, a handful of billionaires divide up the riches of the planet.democrats must start playing ball in states that we have conceded decades ago, where people are now being left out of the political process.the women of this country have the right to control their own bodies, not politicians.for decades, republicans and democrats have understood that the goal must be to reduce the number of nuclear weapons, not expand them.we must stand with our brothers and sisters in nc who despite the gop power grab are bravely fighting for economic, racial &amp; social justice.my parents' dream was that if they worked hard as parents, they'd see their kids go to college. we must keep that promise to every family.it's a miracle a nuclear weapon hasn't been used in war since . congress can't allow the tweeter in chief to stâ€¦ are we comfortable to see a huge increase in millionaires and billionaires but have more people living in poverty than ever? i know i'm not.the ruling class likes to believe this country belongs to them. there are millions of us who would say otherwise.we must stop the movement toward oligarchy and fight for an economy which works for all, not just the %. if we want to get tough on crime, let us deal with the causes of crime instead of using taxpayer money to incarcerate millions of people.if mr. trump tries to pursue discriminatory policies, he should remember that a majority of voters did not support him and his bigotry.we are rapidly moving toward a nation of the super-rich, by the super-rich and for the super-rich.believing in climate change is not optional at this point. neither is taking action to save the planet.garnishing social security benefits to pay off student debt is a clear example of why we need fundamental changes in our national prioritiesit is beyond absurd that so many bright young people are unable to attend college because of the cost.we are moving toward an oligarchic form of society, and it will take all of us to fight against it.clinton received almost  million more votes, but trump will be the next president. it's clear the electoral college needs to be changed.lowering prices on prescription drugsâ€”that is, making sure that people can afford to liveâ€”should not be a partisan issue.every person in this country deserves a decent opportunity and a decent standard of living. until that happens we will not truly be free.it would be nice to put off worrying about climate change for a few decades. but the truth is we have no choice but to act now.we are living in a nation which worships wealth rather than caring for the poor. i don't think that is the nation we should be living in.the wealthy have seen their incomes rise immensely in the last  years. it is not class warfare to say they don't need another tax break.money and wealth should serve the people. the people should not have to serve money and wealth.there is something profoundly wrong when one family owns more wealth than the bottom  million americans.cuts to life and death programs like medicare and massive tax breaks for the wealthyâ€”that's not what america is supposed to be about.even though the same proportion of blacks and whites use marijuana, a black person is almost x more likely to be arrested for possession.walmart costs taxpayers $. billion every year in public assistance programs by not paying their workers a living wage. that is insane.congress must begin listening to the majority of americans who do not want cuts to medicaid and medicare.our job is to grow the union movement so that anyone working  hours a week, whether itâ€™s in a factory or a hotel, doesn't live in poverty.a small subsection of the one percent are hell-bent on doing everything in their power to block action against climate change.young people in this country should be in good schools and at good jobs, not in jail cells.there is hatred being generated against immigrants in this country. we've got to stand together and reject that hate.rt @nowthisnews: watch @berniesanders change a trump supporter's mind in  seconds rt @latenightseth: our pal @berniesanders returns to #lnsm tonight! donâ€™t miss

need to repeal the  welfare reform provisions and expand, not weaken, the social safety net.in , @hillaryclinton said that â€œwelfare should not be an anti-poverty program.â€ i disagree.this legislation has weakened the social safety net and increased extreme poverty. that is unacceptable.this legislation gave republican governors like scott walker the responsibility to provide a safety net for families in need.in , welfare provided a vital safety net to more than  million americans. today, it only helps . million."families living in poverty receiving cash benefits:: %: only %"from  to , households living in extreme poverty increased % for african americans; % for hispanics; % for white americans.the number of children in extreme poverty has skyrocketed from . million to . million.it established strict work requirements for receiving benefits and severely limited access to benefits for undocumented people.since this legislation was signed into law, families living in extreme poverty have more than doubled from , to . million.it turns out that the welfare reform bill has been an absolute disaster.unfortunately, @hillaryclinton supported this bill calling it â€œa critical first step to reforming our nationâ€™s welfare system.â€i called that bill â€œan assault on the poor, women and children, minorities, and immigrants.â€ i believed that then and i believe that now."one of the biggest differences between the clintons and myself in this campaign is our view on welfare reform.it wasn't governor cuomo who had the idea to raise the minimum
