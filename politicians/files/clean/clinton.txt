you disclose the nature of your personal and business relationships with all of the russian oligarchs you are â€œcloseâ€ to?. to what extent would your foreign policy be dictated by potential

partnership with someone connected to iranian money laundering? . if you were willing to work with qaddafiâ€”a known terrorist and dictatorâ€”is there anyone you aren't willing to make a deal with? who?. while refusing to release your tax returns, how will you confirm that you do not have dangerous financial ties to bad actors abroad?. how will you handle non-cancelable contractual obligations with parties whose interests conflict with those of the united states?. will you sever ties with your company linked to foreign leaders, questionable organizations, and criminals if you become
