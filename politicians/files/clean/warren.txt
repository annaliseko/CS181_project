@hardees ceo andrew puzder made a fortune squeezing his workers â€“ the same workers heâ€™d be charged with protecting at @usdol..@senschumerâ€™s concerns about judge gorsuch should worry everyone who cares about the independence of our courts. iâ€™m speaking on the sen floor now to urge my colleagues to vote no on steve mnuchin's @ustreasury nomination. thereâ€™s nothing in steve mnuchinâ€™s record to suggest he could stand up to wall street â€“ or that heâ€™d even want to stand up to wall street.consider this my warning: we wonâ€™t be silent. we will speak out. and we will persist.and you better believe every senator who voted to put jeff sessionsâ€™s radical hatred into @thejusticedept will hear from all of us, too.if jeff sessions makes even the tiniest attempt to bring his racism, sexism &amp; bigotry into @thejusticedept, he'll hear from all of us.if jeff sessions turns a blind eye while @realdonaldtrump violates the constitution or breaks the law, he'll hear from all of us.thereâ€™s no rule  to silence me from talking about jeff sessions anymore. so let me say loudly &amp; clearly: this is just the beginning.thanks to you, everyone now knows the concerns that coretta scott king had about jeff sessions. concerns that millions of people still have.deeply disappointed that the senate confirmed an ag whose record does not show he will faithfully &amp; fairly enforce the law.iâ€™m deeply disappointed that the senate voted to confirm jeff sessions as attorney general tonight..@antiochcollege's coretta scott king center is right: mrs. kingâ€™s words about sessions should be heard. thank you. thank you @sensanders for reading coretta scott king's letter on the senate floor. it is powerfully important. thank you to the police, clerks, stenographers, cloakroom staff, pages, &amp; sen officers who worked all night while @senatedems #holdthefloor.still banned from floor, but spoke w/ civil rights leaders this am to say: coretta scott king will not be silenced. thank you @sensherrodbrown. coretta scott king will not be silenced. many thanks to @senatortomudall for reading coretta scott kingâ€™s letter on the senate floor. thank you @senjeffmerkley for bringing coretta scott kingâ€™s words back to the us senate. tonight @senatemajldr silenced mrs king's voice on the sen floor - &amp; millions who are afraid &amp; appalled by what's happening in our country.i will not be silent while the republicans rubber stamp an ag who will never stand up to the @potus when he breaks the law.i will not be silent about a nominee for ag who has made derogatory &amp; racist comments that have no place in our justice system.i spoke out about @senatorsessions â€“ until @senatemajldr mcconnell decided to silence me. on the floor, i read a letter that coretta scott king wrote in  opposing @senatorsessions's judicial nomination: tonight on the senate floor, i tried to speak about why @senatorsessions is totally unfit to serve as attorney general.heading to the floor to ask: where are the senators who will say no to @senatorsessions for ag? watch: .@senatedems are once again going to #holdthefloor all night â€“ this time to speak out against @senatorsessionsâ€™s nomination for ag..@realdonaldtrump should listen to companies and to consumers and stop financial adviser conflicts costing savers $ billion a year.i asked leading financial firms about @usdol's rule. they told me: itâ€™s good for families &amp;

health of our people could be in the hands of  men who lied to the us senate.this morning, the @senategop unilaterally changed the committee rules to ram through price &amp; mnuchin without a single democrat present..@senatedems insisted: no vote on these nominees until we bring them back in to explain why they lied. perfectly reasonable, right?.@hhsgov nom price lied to the senate about a sweetheart stock deal. @ustreasury nom mnuchin lied about his bankâ€™s illegal foreclosures.i strongly oppose rex tillersonâ€™s nomination for secstate &amp; will vote against his confirmation today. hereâ€™s why. given what's happening, rex tillerson's extensive russia ties mean we cannot trust him to be a strong advocate for america's interests.i wish things were normal. but there is nothing normal about this @potus and his administrationâ€™s disturbing relationship with russia.no, @realdonaldtrump, your illegal, unconstitutional, immoral muslim ban is not about keeping us safe at all. based on the long and well-established record of judge neil gorsuch, i will oppose his nomination. heading to the senate floor now to discuss why i will be voting no on rex tillerson for secretary of state. watch: itâ€™s time for the senate to stand up for the constitution &amp; exert moral leadership. i urge my colleagues: vote no on jeff sessions for ag.jeff sessions is so dangerous that a republican-controlled senate rejected his nomination to a federal judgeship  years ago.trump expects us to replace the ag w/ jeff sessions, whose career is defined by hostility to civil rights, immigrants &amp; the rule of law.let me repeat: the @potus fired the nationâ€™s top law enforcement officer for refusing to defend an illegal, unconstitutional, immoral order.last night, the acting ag refused to defend @realdonaldtrumpâ€™s unlawful &amp; unconstitutional muslim ban, so trump fired her.watch live now as i speak out from the senate floor about @realdonaldtrump's muslim ban:  #nobannowalliâ€™ll also be sharing the views of nonpartisan experts who are alarmed that this policy will harm our national security. #nobannowalliâ€™ll be sharing stories from people in ma terrified about what @realdonaldtrumpâ€™s executive action means for their loved ones. #nobannowalltonight @senatedems will hold the floor as we speak out against @realdonaldtrumpâ€™s illegal &amp; unconstitutional muslim ban. #nobannowallwhat a view tonight in front of the supreme court as congressional dems &amp; hundreds of people gathered to sayâ€¦ i urge my colleagues: vote no on steve mnuchin. donâ€™t put the fates of the families you represent in the hands of a lying wall st insider.steve mnuchin won't give us an honest answer about his foreclosure record. he's not going to give us one when we give him our economy.if steve mnuchin were the captain of the titanic, heâ€™d deny ever hitting the iceberg.you have to wonder, @senatedems &amp; @senategop: what else is steve mnuchin willing to lie about if we hand him the keys to @ustreasury?mnuchin lied about his bankâ€™s illegal tactics in response to @senbobcasey's q's. thereâ€™s no other way to say it. .@senatedems brought victims of mnuchinâ€™s bank to dc when @gopsenfinance refused to hear their stories. steve mnuchin ran a bank that aggressively &amp; sometimes illegally foreclosed on more than k families. thatâ€™s not up for debate. itâ€™s fact.rt @bu_tweets: in @bostonglobe, bu's president brown takes a stand against trump's travel ban &amp; discusses its impact on #highered: i told k+ ppl in ma: we'll fight in courts, congress &amp;

college students who sought safety from terrorists.we are a country of immigrants &amp; refugees, of people fleeing religious persecution &amp; seeking freedom, a country made strong by diversity..@realdonaldtrump's order restricting immigrants from muslim countries &amp; freezing admission of refugees is a betrayal of american values.letâ€™s be clear: a muslim ban by any other name is still a muslim ban.today, @realdonaldtrump closed the door on that little girl â€“ &amp; so many others who are running for their lives.i thought about what horrors must have possessed her parents to hand a wad of cash &amp; their little girl over to human smugglers.and i met a -yr-old girl â€“ younger than my own granddaughters â€“ who had been sent out on that perilous journey aloâ€¦ i saw the plastic pool floaties parents put on small children, hoping that would be enough to save them if the raftâ€¦ i saw the shoddy, paper-thin rubber rafts that people cram onto with a hope &amp;

cheat students.betsy devos repeatedly demonstrated contempt for public ed. she plans to maintain financial ties that could create conflicts of interest.i will vote against betsy devosâ€™s nomination for @usedgov because itâ€™s not in the best interests of americaâ€™s young people..@realdonaldtrumpâ€™s actions today show an ugly indifference to immigrants &amp; a profound misunderstanding of the real dangers we face..@realdonaldtrumpâ€™s actions will divert local police dept resources away from protecting &amp; building trust in our communities..@realdonaldtrumpâ€™s actions will waste taxpayer dollars on irresponsible &amp; misguided pet political projects..@realdonaldtrumpâ€™s actions will hurt working parents &amp; children who have risked their lives to flee war, violence &amp; poverty.none of @realdonaldtrumpâ€™s actions today will make us safer. theyâ€™ll tear apart the fabric that makes us strong &amp; united.why not just declare january th as the trump administration's first anti-immigrant day?iâ€™ve heard from many people about my vote for dr. ben carson â€“ so iâ€™ve explained it the best i can: if @repmickmulvaney thinks the @cfpb is a "sad, sick joke," maybe he should spend more time talking to his constituentsthose are just some of the dozens of constituents â€“ including servicemembers &amp; seniors â€“ who have gotten money back or other help from @cfpbmaybe @repmickmulvaney should take a look at some of the complaints his constituents have filed with the @cfpb: budget director nominee @repmickmulvaney said today he believes the @cfpb is a â€œsad, sick jokeâ€ and that he finds the agency â€œoffensiveâ€iâ€™m glad the @cfpb is cleaning up student loan servicing and holding @navient accountable. thatâ€™s why we need a strong consumer agency.thereâ€™s a reason why @navient usually scores dead last in every @usedgov borrower satisfaction survey.every time i tweet or post about @navient, students and families share stories about how they were harmed by this student loan giant.we all know @navient has been caught red-handed cheating students and servicemembers before. now the ceo of @navient is whining to @washingtonpost about getting caught by the @cfpb. give me a break. last week, @cfpb, @ilattygeneral, &amp; @agowa all sued @navient (fmr sallie mae) for cheating students. perhaps @potus @realdonaldtrump &amp; the @gop didnâ€™t get the message saturday: weâ€™re not taking womenâ€™s rights back â€“ not now, &amp; not ever.iâ€™ve been a cosponsor of a bill to repeal the global gag rule. iâ€™ll be st in line to cosponsor again when @senatorshaheen reintroduces it..@potus trump is reinstating the â€œglobal gag ruleâ€ to stop funding for overseas health centers that may provide abortion. this is insanity.attacking @ppfa &amp; us womenâ€™s reproductive rights isnâ€™t enough for @realdonaldtrump &amp; the @gop. today they made their fight global.we must measure @potus @realdonaldtrump by actions, not only words. and today he made it harder for families to achieve the american dream.thatâ€™s , families who just lost their chance to buy a home thanks to brand-new @potus @realdonaldtrump..@potus suspended a planned cut in fha mortgage insurance premiums, which @nardotrealtor says will cost k families a shot at a new home.just minutes after taking the oath of office, @potus trump made it harder for working families to get a mortgage. thank you for your terrific service, @johnkerry. youâ€™ve made ma proud, and weâ€™re looking forward to having you back in the commonwealth.today at  et, @senatedems are hosting a forum with ppl whoâ€™d be hurt by priceâ€™s health care policies. watch live: and yesterday at his @hhsgov hearing, tom price wouldnâ€™t commit to protecting medicare &amp; medicaid from massive cuts. rep tom price - @realdonaldtrumpâ€™s pick to run @hhsgov - is the lead architect of legislation to repeal the affordable care act.when mnuchin makes mistakes on complicated paperwork, he asks for forgiveness. when his customers made mistakes, he took their homes.heather mccreary lost her home when mnuchinâ€™s bank said she sent the wrong check with her complicated paperwork. steve mnuchin told @senstabenow &amp; @senatormenendez he didnâ€™t disclose $m because â€œthe amount of paperworkâ€ was tough. boo hoo.the people who broke our economy &amp; ruined peopleâ€™s lives need to be held accountable. not given the keys to break our economy again.no, @senorrinhatch, @potus didnâ€™t force mnuchin &amp;

(nope.) .@hhsgov nominee tom price proposed a whopping $ billion in medicare cuts &amp; $ trillion in medicaid cuts as chair of @housebudgetgop..@realdonaldtrump promised over &amp; over that he wouldnâ€™t cut medicare &amp;

radically restructure medicaid â€“ weakening our nationâ€™s health care.tom price championed aca repeal. heâ€™s opposed improvements to womenâ€™s care. heâ€™s cosponsored leg to discriminate against lgbt ppl.the job of @hhsgov sec is to â€œenhance &amp;

@agschneidermanâ€” a prime example of @housegop abuse of power.the gop-led @housescience committee is helping @exxonmobil deny the reality of climate change.today in the @nejm i write about the need for transparency in our clinical trial system to improve people's health: yesterday @massago took an important step to stop the spread of lethal assault-style weapons. read more here: let me offer you a word of advice, @lamarsmithtx &amp; your @exxonmobil buddies: you picked a fight with the wrong state &amp; the wrong ag.this is an outrageous abuse of congressional subpoena power to threaten a state ag and help a campaign contributor.for the @gop, statesâ€™ rights only apply for restricting voting rights or regulating womenâ€™s bodies. not investigating climate change fraud..@lamarsmithtx says he â€œtakes very seriously his obligation to uphold &amp; defend the constitutionâ€ â€” but apparently not the th amendment.yup, thatâ€™s right: house republicans are interfering with a state agâ€™s ongoing investigation of a company violating state law.now @exxonmobil got the chair of the @housescience committee â€” a tx republican who has taken $k from oil &amp; gas â€” to subpoena @massago.first @exxonmobil tried to stop @massago by suing healey in a tx court &amp; attacking her integrity because sheâ€™s doing her job..@massago maura healey is investigating whether @exxonmobil broke state laws by knowingly misleading people about climate change.want to see how giant corporations rig the system? look at what @exxonmobil is doing to intimidate @massago to stop fraud investigation.heartsick for the families of the baton rouge police officers killed today. more violence &amp; bloodshed won't fix the pain in our country.the @cfpb is proof that government can work for the people. #consumerscount we need our gov agencies to work together to warn students, veterans &amp; families about other unlicensed â€œuniversitiesâ€ like trump â€œu.â€ senate dems &amp; i sent a letter to @usedgov, @ftc, @cfpb &amp; @deptvetaffairs about fake schools like trump â€œuâ€: trump u violated ny law by calling itself a "university" without a charter or license. vulnerable people lost big bucks to trump's scheme.the @housegop should be ashamed. the last thing congress should be doing is giving homophobic americans a license to discriminate.the gop #fada bill could let hospitals, government workers, employers, &amp; even landlords discriminate against married same-sex couples.marriage equality is the law of the land. but #lgbt americans still lack federal protections against discrimination they desperately need.iâ€™m not joking: @housegop are holding a hearing right now about making it easier for people to discriminate against #lgbt americans.our country has seen too many tragedies this month. so what are the @housegop doing right now? holding a hearing to legalize hate.i wish i had the answers right now to stop the very real pain that people are feeling, but i know this: change must come. it must come now.i'm sick at heart about those who would pull us apart at exactly the moment when we need to come together.iâ€™m sick at heart for the families of the officers killed in dallas. sick at heart for the families of the men shot in la &amp; mn.black americans shouldn't be killed in routine traffic stops, &amp; police shouldn't be killed while protecting &amp; serving their communities.no. no. no. no. no. more killing solves nothing. more grieving moms &amp; dads, sons &amp; daughters cannot bring back those weâ€™ve already  lost.#blacklivesmatter must be more than a hashtag or trending topic every time a tragedy happens. we must all come together to make it true.we can't ignore the ugly reality: black parents are terrified that teaching kids to â€œsurviveâ€ the police won't be enough. #blacklivesmattermost cops are good ppl. but we canâ€™t ignore the ugly reality: black parents feel they must teach kids to â€œsurviveâ€ police. #blacklivesmatterweâ€™ve seen the sickening videos of black americans killed in traffic stops. lives ended by those sworn to protect them. #blacklivesmattersandra bland. freddie gray. michael brown. walter scott. tamir rice. eric garner. now alton sterling &amp;

@senategop don't take #zika seriously, more ppl get sick.  pregnant women in us states &amp; territories have zika now.is this some sort of sick joke, @senategop? is the #zika virus â€” and our countryâ€™s response to this emergency â€” just a game to you?!i didnâ€™t think the gop could write  bill to hurt women, vets, obamacare, pp, and clean water all at once â€“ but they did it. #zikathe gop #zika bill cuts senate levels of @deptvetaffairs funding by $m â€“ money for va hospital maintenance &amp; raises for doctors &amp; nurses.the gop #zika bill rolls back clean water act requirements designed to keep pesticides out of americansâ€™ drinking water.the gop #zika bill blocks @ppfa from receiving birth control grant money that would help poor women with zika avoid having deformed babies.the gop #zika bill guts money from healthcare exchanges in the affordable care act (#obamacare) to pay for the emergency response.the gop #zika bill steals money from the #ebola response fund, even though we still have  cdc staff on ground fighting the outbreak.the gop #zika bill provides $ million less in funding than the @whitehouse requested. money we need for prevention &amp; treatment.then while @housedemocrats fought for gun violence votes at #nobillnobreak, the @housegop jammed through a terrible #zika bill at am. months ago, the @whitehouse requested $.b to fight #zika. dems asked the gop to act â€“ and the gop dragged their feet.my blood is boiling over the pathetic, dishonest &amp; malicious #zika funding bill that @senatemajldr mcconnell &amp; the gop just tried to pass..@speakerryan &amp; the @housegop: you should be ashamed of yourselves for your totally corrupt priorities. people are watching..@housedemocrats: please vote no on this veto override. we werenâ€™t sent here to do dirty work for wall stâ€™s armies of lawyers &amp;

regulators show some backbone.no execs lost their jobs in exchange for taxpayer rescue. none went to jail. some, like jamie dimon, are still running the same banks.big bank execs got rich but when it all predictably blew up, the gov lavished their institutions with billions in bailouts.the big banks spread risk throughout the system by misleading investors about the quality of mortgages in the securities they were offering.there would be no crisis without these giant banks that encouraged reckless mortgage lending &amp; funded slimy subprime lenders.wall st lobbyists have tried to deflect blame for the  crisis for years. but their revisionist history is untrue &amp; dangerous.unless the banks promptly address regulatorsâ€™ concerns, the gov must push these banks to get smaller &amp; less complex. us banks are big enough that any one could crash the economy again if they failed &amp; werenâ€™t bailed out. itâ€™s a very big deal. itâ€™s scary.today, after an extensive review, fed regulators concluded that  of the biggest banks are still too big to fail. the tax filing simplification act is a commonsense bill to push the irs to simplify tax day. learn more: and the tax filing simplification act provides a return-free option for those with simple tax situations.the tax filing simplification act lets taxpayers download third-party-reported tax information that the irs already has.it prohibits the irs from entering into agreements w/ tax prep companies that restrict its ability to provide free online services.my bill directs the irs to develop a free, online tax prep &amp; filing service that taxpayers can use directly w/ the gov.today i introduced the tax filing simplification act to help taxpayers file with less stress &amp; fewer costs.congress should be making it easier for americans to file their taxes, not bowing to the interests of the tax prep industry.this year, taxpayers will spend an average of  hrs prepping taxes &amp;

give consumers better tools for info.  another sign the bipartisan chorus is growing to make sure wall street fund managers pay their fair share: read my new @talkpoverty op-ed on why we need the #savebenefits act to give seniors &amp; vets a ss raise: any conversation about tackling poverty in the us should include protecting &amp; expanding social security.the @cfpb should move soon &amp; robustly on its new rules for payday lenders. no delays, and no carve-outs.the @cfpb is doing a great job to crack down on the tricks &amp; traps in payday loans. congress should back the @cfpb, not sabotage it.until the @cfpb, no federal agency was responsible for overseeing payday lenders, who can stick vulnerable people with rates up to %.. million households borrow from payday lenders each year, with more storefronts in the us than mcdonaldâ€™s and starbucks combined.fmla was a huge step fwd, and we must do more. read my @bostonglobe op-ed on how to level the playing field: we need real agency reform to level the playing field - not to give lobbyists more chances to block outcomes they donâ€™t like.read my letter to @ctfc commissioner giancarlo, calling on him to withdraw this report: the @cftc committeeâ€™s report is little more than a recitation of industry talking points and should be treated as such.the @cftc report is riddled w/ problems &amp; mischaracterizations, &amp; adopted without public discussion or public vote.the advisory committee behind this compromised @cftc report consists almost entire of industry insiders â€“ violating dodd-frank.today that advisory committee presented a final report that is critical of the @cftcâ€™s proposed rule on commodities futures &amp; swaps.under dodd-frank, congress directed the @cftc to establish the eemac â€“ an advisory committee for diverse views on cftc actions.today i joined the @senatedems at the supreme court to tell the gop: #doyourjob on a #scotus nominee. medical experts agree: whatever you think of medical marijuana, it's  irresponsible not to study the science:  serious medical research on medical marijuana is largely blocked by outdated federal laws &amp; policies.medical marijuana might be a viable alternative to opioids for pain treatment, but truthfully, there's a lot we just don't know.partial fill policies for opioids can help reduce the number of unused pills in circulation. watch:  #partialfillbillwishing my very best for a speedy recovery to one of the senateâ€™s toughest fighters, @clairecmc. the whole twitterverse is here for you!abandoning their senate duties would also prove that all the republican talk about loving the constitution is just that â€“ empty talk.the senate gop took an oath just like dems did. abandoning the duties they swore to uphold threatens the constitution &amp; our democracy.i canâ€™t find a clause in the constitution that says â€œâ€¦except when thereâ€™s a year left in the term of a democratic president.â€art ii sec  of the constitution says the president nominates supreme court justices with the advice &amp; consent of the senate..@senatemajldr is right that americans should have a voice in selecting the next scotus justice. in fact, they did: when @potus won in .the sudden death of justice scalia creates an immediate vacancy on the most important court in the united states..@repcummings &amp; i sent a letter to @usdol about advisorsâ€™ wildly conflicting messages on a conflict of interest rule but when these retirement advisors talk to their own stockholders, the doomsday predictions disappear &amp; the companies say theyâ€™ll be fine.financial companies have predicted dire consequences from a new rule requiring them to act in customersâ€™ best interests.i won't support more "innovation" proposals until we have a bipartisan agreement to strengthen @us_fda &amp; seriously fund medical research.watch my remarks to the help committee today on why congress needs to commit to funding medical research: heading into an election, it'd be easy for congress to pass some small bills, declare victory &amp; quit. but that's not good enough.last yr, @newtgingrich said ignoring this nih funding problem â€œtakes a special kind of stupidity that is reserved for this city.â€ i agree.big medical breakthroughs come from basic research. instead of funding that research, congress has spent a decade choking off support.the senate help committee approved bills today to advance us medical innovation. i voted for those bills - but it isn't enough.on #fmla, we remember how much more we need to do to level the playing field for workers &amp; families. on #goredforwomen day, iâ€™m fighting to double nih funding to help millions of women live longer, healthier lives. if we want strong enforcement, personnel is policy. read commissioner bowenâ€™s call for tougher wall st enforcement: every single house republican who came to work today just voted to make it harder to hold big banks accountable for fraud. shameful.tell congress: they work for the american people â€” not wall street banks that break the law. vote no on hr .you read that right: the house is just minutes away from voting on a bill to make it tougher to investigate &amp; prosecute bank fraud.nope â€” right now on the house floor, wall st buddies are pushing a bill to make it tougher to prosecute bank fraud.youâ€™d think big banks would be happy with enforcement so tepid that they could just bake fines into the cost of doing business, right?systematic fraud on wall st helped spark the  financial crisis â€“ but not a single wall st executive went to jail.if anyone in congress thinks they can make it harder to crack down on corporate criminals, i promise you: the american people are watching.today i spoke on the senate floor about our rigged justice system for the rich &amp; powerful. watch: the american people remember who broke our economy &amp; who made out like bandits â€“ and they didnâ€™t send us here to help the bandits.want to see the rigged game in action? tomorrow, the house will vote on a gop bill to make it harder to investigate &amp; prosecute bank fraud.itâ€™s not equal justice when a kid gets thrown in jail for stealing a car, while a ceo gets a huge raise when his company steals billions.we have one set of law on the books, but two legal systems: one for the rich &amp; powerful, and one for everyone else.heading to the senate floor now to discuss my enforcement report &amp; gop efforts to weaken wall st accountability: today i urged congress to reject the #tpp deal before it makes things even worse for americaâ€™s families: congress will have to vote straight up or down on #tpp.  we wonâ€™t have a chance to strip out any of the worst provisions, like isds.a rigged process produces a rigged outcome. evidence of this tilt can be seen in a key #tpp provision: isds. countries will sign the #tpp trade deal on thursday - but it won't go into effect unless congress approves it.today i asked the senate gop: if you won't support #inthered, then what's your plan for student loan debt? thanks everyone for coming to our springfield open house today! i'm happy to fight for western ma in the senate. the next president can honor the simple notion that nobody is above the law, but it will happen only if voters demand it.read my new @nytimes op-ed about how personnel is policy for enforcing federal laws: today my office released a report on  of the worst federal enforcement failures in : presidents donâ€™t control most day-to-day enforcement decisions, but they do nominate heads of agencies. that makes all the difference.much of the attention on dc focuses on enacting laws, but a law that's not enforced may as well not even be a law at all. candidates are pitching their legislative agendas, but voters should consider what presidents can do without congress.today we remember framinghamâ€™s christa mcauliffe &amp; the astronauts we lost  yrs ago on #challenger: i donâ€™t love wall st bankers who break our economy â€“ but i loved #thebigshort. great to meet @ghostpanther today! yesterday, @senatedems announced our new #inthered campaign to help students getting crushed with debt. this congress doesnâ€™t lack workable ideas for how to root out the influence of money in politics; it just lacks the spine to do them.hereâ€™s a whole list of things congress could do if we had the courage to stand up to the super-wealthy few: we can â€“ and we should â€“ blame the supreme court for #citizensunited. but that is no excuse for doing nothing.money floods our political system, letting a handful of billionaires shape who gets into congress &amp; may decide who sits in the white house.six years ago today, #citizensunited turned loose a flood of hidden money that is about to drown our democracy.consumers need a central place to turn to for help when they are denied coverage for mental health care. watch: our acting ed sec @johnkingated hit a home run by asking rohit chopra to help fix our broken student loan system. .@potus &amp;
