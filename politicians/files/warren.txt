If the @SenateGOP pass this bill, they'll show they just donâ€™t care about American families.Only in the GOP alternative upside down reality can you hate a bill so much that youâ€™re going to vote for it.Hereâ€™s what you learn in â€œHow to be a Senator 101â€: If you support a bill, you vote yes. If you donâ€™t, you vote no.Mark my words: If the GOP canâ€™t get a deal in committee that destroys the ACA even more, â€œskinny repealâ€ will become the law of the land.If the @SenateGOP wanted a bill they could fix in committee, it couldâ€™ve been blank piece of paper. They CHOSE to intro this malicious bill.And hereâ€™s the worst part: The @SenateGOP knows this bill is appalling. One senator called it â€œa disaster.â€ â€œThe dumbest thing in history.â€CBO says this latest garbage bill will lead to 16 MILLION more uninsured. https://t.co/huOjkQsfhaThis @SenateGOP bill theyâ€™re voting on tonight kills a part of the ACA key to keeping insurance affordable for everyone.From what I can tell, â€œskinny repealâ€ just means gutting important parts of the Affordable Care Act.So hereâ€™s the deal: In the dead of night tonight, the @SenateGOP will try to pass a â€œskinny repealâ€ of health care.The @SenateGOP â€œskinny billâ€ is here and itâ€™s exactly as wretched as we thought itâ€™d be. https://t.co/nRxBnQloQB"Câ€™mon, @SenateGOP.

We're doing everything we can to defend the health care of millions of Americans.In addition to being cruel, this first @SenateGOP proposal violates the Budget Act, so it needs 60 votes.

It underscores why our Constitution doesn't let Presidents wage war alone.Within a week, Trump's Admin went from asserting they wouldn't intervene to launching Tomahawk missiles against Assad. That's erratic.We need a plan to hold Assad accountable. But so far Iâ€™ve seen no compelling strategic justification for Trump's missile strike.Glass-Steagall has bipartisan support: from @SenSanders to @realDonaldTrump; both @TheDemocrats &amp; @RNC platforms. Letâ€™s get this done.Today, @SenJohnMcCain, @SenatorCantwell, @SenAngusKing &amp; I are reintroducing the 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act.â€¦ https://t.co/FFgMYHFIxgGlass-Steagall was one of the 1st bills I introduced in the Senate 4 yrs ago with @SenJohnMcCain, @SenatorCantwell &amp; @SenAngusKing.If bankers want to go gamble with complex financial products, ok â€“ but they shouldnâ€™t do it with the money in grandmaâ€™s checking account.But letâ€™s get real: Most of the big banks are even bigger now than when we declared them â€œtoo big to failâ€ in 2008 &amp; bailed them out.Weâ€™ve made some real progress since Wall Streetâ€™s high-risk bets brought our economy to its knees.If ever we needed a strong, independent Supreme Court with broad public support, itâ€™s now. Rules change or not, weâ€™ll keep fighting for it.The GOP will be responsible for every 5-4 decision that throws working Americans under the bus to favor the powerful, moneyed few.The GOP will have to own every 5-4 case that opens the floodgates even more to secret spending in our political system.The GOP will have to own every 5-4 attack on womenâ€™s rights, voting rights, LGBT rights, &amp; freedom of speech &amp; religion.Changing the rules to jam through a right-wing, corporate-owned judge means the GOP will have to own the Gorsuch Court.I get that the GOP wonâ€™t pick a progressive.

When we get out there &amp; fight, we can make a real difference.But I'm not doing a touchdown dance today. Not when the GOP is still hell-bent on rigging the system for the rich &amp; powerful.Today is a great day for the people of Massachusetts &amp; people across the country who depend on the Affordable Care Act.The truth will come out, @GOP. Get on the right side of history before it's too late.The idea that Devin Nunes will investigate Trump/Russia is a farce. It's time for a real, independent, transparent inquiry.The FBI is investigating collusion between @realDonaldTrump's campaign &amp; Russia. When will the GOP end the charade &amp; put country first?Meanwhile, reports today say @realDonaldTrump's campaign manager was paid millions to help Putin influence US politics. Drip. Drip. Drip.After slamming leaks as "criminal," Devin Nunes is now privately briefing @realDonaldTrump - even leaking info to help him.Who does House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes think he works for: the American people or @realDonaldTrump?"The @SenateGOP would undo @FCC rules &amp; let internet service providers sell private info without telling customers.https://t.co/v8y2RcIv6D"Now the @SenateGOP is obsessed with using the Congressional Review Act to kill every consumer protection rule in sight, like the @FCC rules..@SenMarkey is right: the @FCC protected consumers by adopting #BroadbandPrivacy rules â€“ on how companies collect/use/share/sell our data.Massachusetts Sec of State Galvin is right to be worried: @realDonaldTrump's bigotry &amp; hate could greatly influenceâ€¦ https://t.co/SeqFz5XbEcHeading to the Senate floor now to talk about @realDonaldTrumpâ€™s efforts to cut OSHA safety for workers.

Lifetime court appointments can wait.But is the Senate really going to pretend there's no cloud over @realDonaldTrump &amp; move on w/ the Gorsuch nomination like things are normal?I've strongly opposed the Gorsuch nomination. Giant companies don't need another Supreme Court justice to tilt the law in their favor.Neil Gorsuch is up for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court from a President whose campaign is under FBI investigation.Instead of siding with the big banks, the @HouseGOP should join @HouseDemocrats in ensuring that the @CFPB remains a strong cop on the beat.Today, the GOP @FinancialCmte has a hearing about â€œrestructuringâ€ the @CFPB â€“ another way of saying they want to weaken it.The @CFPB is widely popular with the American people â€“ and widely hated by the big Wall Street banks it regulates.The @CFPB is a tough watchdog for working families, forcing big banks to return more than $12B to people they cheated.Transparency, pressure &amp; activism work. But weâ€™re going to need a whole lot more of it to make @usedgov work for students.The DeVos aide who resigned last week? His dad happened to run the student loan company that sued @usedgov about that pro-borrower policy.The damage has already been done. @usedgov announced it would let student loan companies charge some struggling students outrageous fees.The same day I wrote to DeVos about her aidesâ€™ obvious conflicts, one of them apparently resigned. https://t.co/KIw0enbJ8OI asked Betsy DeVos why 2 of her key aides are fmr for-profit college execs with massive conflicts of interest. https://t.co/NGc3oJGERMEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos apparently thinks her job is to hand @usedgov over to people who want to bilk students.Read my @BostonGlobe op-ed about why I oppose Neil Gorsuchâ€™s nomination for the Supreme Court. https://t.co/aHh5ioaBv6We donâ€™t need another Supreme Court justice to help giant corporations.

Stop fighting the rule of law and start fighting for all Americans..@realDonaldTrump's illegal Muslim ban is still a recruiting tool for ISIS. Still a betrayal of our values. Still doesn't keep us safe.Turns out, an illegal Muslim ban by another name is still an illegal Muslim ban. So the courts just blocked @realDonaldTrump's second one.Now is the time to speak out about the importance of the ACA &amp; Medicaid to your family &amp; stop this cruel #Trumpcare bill in its tracks.Today I told the Senate: If #Trumpcare passes, people will lose access to opioid recovery services. People will die. https://t.co/6x34DLVk61Gutting the ACA with #Trumpcare is like shoving a stick of dynamite in this countryâ€™s opioid treatment gap &amp; lighting the fuse.Consider what #Trumpcare will do to families &amp; communities struggling with the opioid crisis. We already have an opioid treatment gap.There's no other way to say it: #Trumpcare is just part of a GOP plan to help the rich get richer &amp; kick dirt in everyone else's face.Who thinks the central problem in America is that middle class families have too much health care &amp; rich people need more gov handouts?What kind of health care bill has as its central feature ripping insurance away from tens of millions of American citizens?About to speak about the devastating impact that #Trumpcare will have on fighting the opioid crisis in MA.

You can't shut down ongoing investigations by career prosecutors..@realDonaldTrump wants people like AG Sessions â€“ a loyalist who lied to the Senate about meeting with the Russians â€“ in @TheJusticeDept..@realDonaldTrump fired acting AG Sally Yates â€“ who refused to defend his #MuslimBan &amp; had warned the WH about Flynnâ€™s contact with Russia.GOP &amp; Dems respect Preet Bharara as a fearless prosecutor who stands up to both parties &amp; Wall Street. I guess that's why Trump fired him.Preet Bharara had authority over Trump Tower. @realDonaldTrump called him directly, breaching protocol. 24 hrs later he was asked to resign.Weeks ago, @realDonaldTrump promised to keep Preet Bharara as the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan. Yesterday, Preet was fired. Why?.@realDonaldTrump talked a big game about getting corruption out of gov. But he wants a bunch of tame prosecutors who wonâ€™t investigate him.Itâ€™s time to junk this cruel #Trumpcare bill before massive numbers of Americans are hurt by it.A health care bill that destroys care &amp; affordable coverage for millions â€“ seriously?

Instead, the GOP wants to make it easier for giant gov contractors to hurt workers.Todayâ€™s debate on the Fair Pay &amp; Safe Workplaces order is about who Congress works for. Iâ€™m here to fight for workers â€“ &amp; Iâ€™ll be voting no.Instead of helping workers, the GOP will vote today to make it easier for companies that hurt workers to get massive gov contracts.My office released a report today that shows 2/3 of the top contractors have been caught breaking labor laws. https://t.co/AOed3xBPYaThe US gov pays billions to federal contractors â€“ but some of the biggest corporations underpay workers &amp; put their health/safety at risk.Read the article @ChuckGrassley &amp; I wrote about our over-the-counter hearing aid bill in @JAMAInternalMed: https://t.co/WXRhQlTiHz.@ChuckGrassley &amp; I have a bipartisan bill to let some hearing aids be sold over-the-counter, saving families money &amp; reducing regulations.Met this morning with the terrific staff of Lynn Community Health Center.

State lawmakers are #fightingforfamilies with bills to stop wage theft.A hard dayâ€™s work deserves a fair dayâ€™s pay. State lawmakers across the country are #fightingforfamilies with bills to expand overtime.And Massachusetts continues to lead the way in #fightingforfamilies with earned sick time &amp; the highest state minimum wage in the country.Massachusetts has shown that #fightingforfamilies can start in states. We did it with marriage equality &amp; health care reform..@realDonaldTrump &amp; the GOP leadership arenâ€™t #fightingforfamilies with policies like raising the min wage, overtime pay or fair scheduling.And we need Attorney General Jeff Sessions â€“ who should have never been confirmed in the first place â€“ to resign. We need it now.We need a special prosecutor totally independent of the AG. We need a real, bipartisan, transparent Congressional investigation into Russia.This is not normal. This is not fake news. This is a very real &amp; serious threat to the national security of the United States.Now Jeff Sessions is AG â€“ the final say on the law enforcement investigation into ties between the Trump campaign &amp; Russia? What a farce.Jeff Sessions answered â€œNo.â€ Turns out he met with the Russian Ambassador. Two months before the election.It's a simple q: "Have you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election?"I'd like for you to meet my guest to the #Jointsession speech tonight: @UMassD student &amp; Iraqi refugee Tiba Faraj. https://t.co/vrkbsok6ejI can name a zillion reasons why MA is the best â€“ but our schools &amp; health care are two very good reasons.

Watch: https://t.co/etvzEJEk7WEvery R who opposes extending debate today is responsible for whatever it turns out is in Pruitt's emails next week. Make the right choice.Considering how obsessed @GOP are with emails, I'd hope they'd vote to extend debate on Pruitt until we can see his secret Big Oil ones..@SenateGOP are jamming through Pruitt at @EPA before his emails come out. At 12:30pm, @SenateDems will force a vote to extend the debate..@EPA nominee Scott Pruitt wouldn't provide his office's records of dealings with Big Oil, so a court ruled he must release them next week.Iâ€™m speaking on the Senate floor now to strong oppose Scott Pruitt to run the @EPA.

Our natl security is at stake.When did @WhiteHouse know that Flynn lied? What other contacts with Russia occurred during the campaign? Who knew what? Who approved what?This. Is. Not. Normal. @realDonaldTrump owes Americans a full account of his Adminâ€™s dealings with Russia, both before &amp; after the election..@realDonaldTrump is still making money overseas &amp; may have financial ties to Russia. Nobody knows since he STILL wonâ€™t release his taxes..@StateDept Sec Rex Tillerson has close ties to Putin. @CommerceGov nominee Wilbur Ross has close financial ties to Putin buddies.Reports say our own intel agencies have corroborated parts of a dossier alleging that Russia has compromising info about @realDonaldTrump.This isnâ€™t a game. Reports say the Russians conducted a series of successful cyber-attacks on our elections to help elect @realDonaldTrump.But American national security demands that we not allow Michael Flynn to become a scapegoat for this Admin's disturbing ties to Russia.Michael Flynnâ€™s blinding religious hatred &amp; shady Russian ties disqualified him as NSA on day one. His removal is a win for American values.I will be voting NO on Steve Mnuchinâ€™s confirmation for @USTreasury tonight. I urge all of my colleagues to do the same.If Wall Street threatens to blow up the economy again, does anyone seriously expect Steve Mnuchin to tell his buddies to knock it off?Personnel is policy. Hiring Mnuchin &amp; all these @GoldmanSachs execs shows @realDonaldTrump has no interest in reducing Wall Stâ€™s influence..@realDonaldTrump talked a big game about Wall St - but he's hired enough @GoldmanSachs alums to open a new bank branch at the @WhiteHouse..@realDonaldTrump said heâ€™d be tough on Wall Street.

We will speak out. And we WILL persist.And you better believe every Senator who voted to put Jeff Sessionsâ€™s radical hatred into @TheJusticeDept will hear from all of us, too.If Jeff Sessions makes even the tiniest attempt to bring his racism, sexism &amp; bigotry into @TheJusticeDept, he'll hear from all of us.If Jeff Sessions turns a blind eye while @realDonaldTrump violates the Constitution or breaks the law, he'll hear from all of us.Thereâ€™s no Rule 19 to silence me from talking about Jeff Sessions anymore. So let me say loudly &amp; clearly: This is just the beginning.Thanks to you, everyone now knows the concerns that Coretta Scott King had about Jeff Sessions. Concerns that millions of people still have.Deeply disappointed that the Senate confirmed an AG whose record does not show he will faithfully &amp; fairly enforce the law.Iâ€™m deeply disappointed that the Senate voted to confirm Jeff Sessions as Attorney General tonight..@AntiochCollege's Coretta Scott King Center is right: Mrs. Kingâ€™s words about Sessions should be heard.

Perfectly reasonable, right?.@HHSGov nom Price lied to the Senate about a sweetheart stock deal. @USTreasury nom Mnuchin lied about his bankâ€™s illegal foreclosures.I strongly oppose Rex Tillersonâ€™s nomination for SecState &amp; will vote against his confirmation today. Hereâ€™s why. https://t.co/rfCJvBbBk2Given what's happening, Rex Tillerson's extensive Russia ties mean we cannot trust him to be a strong advocate for America's interests.I wish things were normal. But there is NOTHING NORMAL about this @POTUS and his Administrationâ€™s disturbing relationship with Russia.No, @realDonaldTrump, your illegal, unconstitutional, immoral Muslim ban is not about keeping us safe at all. https://t.co/vRAyrJXb5OBased on the long and well-established record of Judge Neil Gorsuch, I will oppose his nomination. https://t.co/iYbOWwwGoSHeading to the Senate floor now to discuss why I will be voting NO on Rex Tillerson for Secretary of State. Watch: https://t.co/SRRHUnhCreItâ€™s time for the Senate to stand up for the Constitution &amp; exert moral leadership. I urge my colleagues: Vote NO on Jeff Sessions for AG.Jeff Sessions is so dangerous that a Republican-controlled Senate rejected his nomination to a federal judgeship 30 years ago.Trump expects us to replace the AG w/ Jeff Sessions, whose career is defined by hostility to civil rights, immigrants &amp; the rule of law.Let me repeat: the @POTUS fired the nationâ€™s top law enforcement officer for refusing to defend an illegal, unconstitutional, immoral order.Last night, the acting AG refused to defend @realDonaldTrumpâ€™s unlawful &amp; unconstitutional Muslim ban, so Trump fired her.Watch live now as I speak out from the Senate floor about @realDonaldTrump's Muslim ban: https://t.co/KYG7aJim5s #NoBanNoWallIâ€™ll also be sharing the views of nonpartisan experts who are alarmed that this policy will harm our national security. #NoBanNoWallIâ€™ll be sharing stories from people in MA terrified about what @realDonaldTrumpâ€™s executive action means for their loved ones. #NoBanNoWallTonight @SenateDems will hold the floor as we speak out against @realDonaldTrumpâ€™s illegal &amp; unconstitutional Muslim ban. #NoBanNoWallWhat a view tonight in front of the Supreme Court as Congressional Dems &amp; hundreds of people gathered to sayâ€¦ https://t.co/l1hSzxS4KwI urge my colleagues: vote NO on Steve Mnuchin. Donâ€™t put the fates of the families you represent in the hands of a lying Wall St insider.Steve Mnuchin won't give us an honest answer about his foreclosure record. He's not going to give us one when we give him our economy.If Steve Mnuchin were the Captain of the Titanic, heâ€™d deny ever hitting the iceberg.You have to wonder, @SenateDems &amp; @SenateGOP: What else is Steve Mnuchin willing to lie about if we hand him the keys to @USTreasury?Mnuchin lied about his bankâ€™s illegal tactics in response to @SenBobCasey's q's. Thereâ€™s no other way to say it. https://t.co/lUsVQChRMd.@SenateDems brought victims of Mnuchinâ€™s bank to DC when @GOPSenFinance refused to hear their stories. https://t.co/RMCZNyqxsCSteve Mnuchin ran a bank that aggressively &amp; sometimes illegally foreclosed on more than 60k families.

Rescind this executive order now.On #HolocaustRemembranceDay, we remember what can happen when hatred &amp; fear turns neighbor against neighbor. When we abandon those in need.Turning our back on refugees because of their religion creates recruiting fodder for ISIS and other terrorist groups.The Syrian refugees admitted to the US last yr are kids, doctors, teachers, engineers, &amp; college students who sought safety from terrorists.We are a country of immigrants &amp; refugees, of people fleeing religious persecution &amp; seeking freedom, a country made strong by diversity..@realDonaldTrump's order restricting immigrants from Muslim countries &amp; freezing admission of refugees is a betrayal of American values.Letâ€™s be clear: A Muslim ban by any other name is still a Muslim ban.Today, @realDonaldTrump closed the door on that little girl â€“ &amp; so many others who are running for their lives.I thought about what horrors must have possessed her parents to hand a wad of cash &amp; their little girl over to human smugglers.And I met a 7-yr-old girl â€“ younger than my own granddaughters â€“ who had been sent out on that perilous journey aloâ€¦ https://t.co/bg0F2Ytfr1I saw the plastic pool floaties parents put on small children, hoping that would be enough to save them if the raftâ€¦ https://t.co/j90JTG1nU0I saw the shoddy, paper-thin rubber rafts that people cram onto with a hope &amp; a prayer that theyâ€™ll make it across the choppy, rocky sea.15 months ago, I traveled to the Greek island of Lesvos â€“ the 1st stop for many Syrian refugees as they flee the teâ€¦ https://t.co/4VY1gXnWgoItâ€™s hard to imagine a less qualified or more dangerous @USedgov nominee.

I hear &amp; share their concerns.And Betsy DeVos is unwilling to commit to be a cop on the beat with for-profit colleges that break the law &amp; cheat students.Betsy DeVos repeatedly demonstrated contempt for public ed. She plans to maintain financial ties that could create conflicts of interest.I will vote against Betsy DeVosâ€™s nomination for @USedgov because itâ€™s not in the best interests of Americaâ€™s young people..@realDonaldTrumpâ€™s actions today show an ugly indifference to immigrants &amp; a profound misunderstanding of the real dangers we face..@realDonaldTrumpâ€™s actions will divert local police dept resources away from protecting &amp; building trust in our communities..@realDonaldTrumpâ€™s actions will waste taxpayer dollars on irresponsible &amp; misguided pet political projects..@realDonaldTrumpâ€™s actions will hurt working parents &amp; children who have risked their lives to flee war, violence &amp; poverty.None of @realDonaldTrumpâ€™s actions today will make us safer. Theyâ€™ll tear apart the fabric that makes us strong &amp; united.Why not just declare January 25th as the Trump Administration's First Anti-Immigrant Day?Iâ€™ve heard from many people about my vote for Dr. Ben Carson â€“ so Iâ€™ve explained it the best I can: https://t.co/rOhCeZ4xdpIf @RepMickMulvaney thinks the @CFPB is a "sad, sick joke," maybe he should spend more time talking to his constituentsThose are just some of the dozens of constituents â€“ including servicemembers &amp; seniors â€“ who have gotten money back or other help from @CFPBMaybe @RepMickMulvaney should take a look at some of the complaints his constituents have filed with the @CFPB: https://t.co/E3gdLLbdMOBudget Director nominee @RepMickMulvaney said today he believes the @CFPB is a â€œsad, sick jokeâ€ and that he finds the agency â€œoffensiveâ€Iâ€™m glad the @CFPB is cleaning up student loan servicing and holding @Navient accountable. Thatâ€™s why we need a strong consumer agency.Thereâ€™s a reason why @Navient usually scores dead last in every @usedgov borrower satisfaction survey.Every time I tweet or post about @Navient, students and families share stories about how they were harmed by this student loan giant.We all know @Navient has been caught red-handed cheating students and servicemembers before. https://t.co/BbkUbp8OlvNow the CEO of @Navient is whining to @washingtonpost about getting caught by the @CFPB. Give me a break. https://t.co/LGUIniffPjLast week, @CFPB, @ILAttyGeneral, &amp; @AGOWA all sued @Navient (fmr Sallie Mae) for cheating students. https://t.co/yM5LRlMQU0Perhaps @POTUS @realDonaldTrump &amp; the @GOP didnâ€™t get the message Saturday: Weâ€™re not taking womenâ€™s rights back â€“ not now, &amp; not ever.Iâ€™ve been a cosponsor of a bill to repeal the global gag rule. Iâ€™ll be 1st in line to cosponsor again when @SenatorShaheen reintroduces it..@POTUS Trump is reinstating the â€œglobal gag ruleâ€ to stop funding for overseas health centers that may provide abortion. This is insanity.Attacking @PPFA &amp; US womenâ€™s reproductive rights isnâ€™t enough for @realDonaldTrump &amp; the @GOP. Today they made their fight global.We must measure @POTUS @realDonaldTrump by actions, not only words. And today he made it harder for families to achieve the American Dream.Thatâ€™s 40,000 families who just lost their chance to buy a home thanks to brand-new @POTUS @realDonaldTrump..@POTUS suspended a planned cut in FHA mortgage insurance premiums, which @nardotrealtor says will cost 40k families a shot at a new home.Just minutes after taking the oath of office, @POTUS Trump made it harder for working families to get a mortgage. https://t.co/13ytYnmGptThank you for your terrific service, @JohnKerry. Youâ€™ve made MA proud, and weâ€™re looking forward to having you back in the Commonwealth.Today at 1 ET, @SenateDems are hosting a forum with ppl whoâ€™d be hurt by Priceâ€™s health care policies. Watch live: https://t.co/Q6m4FyZNmiAnd yesterday at his @HHSgov hearing, Tom Price wouldnâ€™t commit to protecting Medicare &amp; Medicaid from massive cuts. https://t.co/1NJ6dYCJK8Rep Tom Price - @realDonaldTrumpâ€™s pick to run @HHSgov - is the lead architect of legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act.When Mnuchin makes mistakes on complicated paperwork, he asks for forgiveness. When his customers made mistakes, he took their homes.Heather McCreary lost her home when Mnuchinâ€™s bank said she sent the wrong check with her complicated paperwork. https://t.co/k9OjA82YfwSteve Mnuchin told @SenStabenow &amp; @SenatorMenendez he didnâ€™t disclose $100M because â€œthe amount of paperworkâ€ was tough. Boo hoo.The people who broke our economy &amp; ruined peopleâ€™s lives need to be held accountable. Not given the keys to break our economy again.No, @SenOrrinHatch, @POTUS didnâ€™t force Mnuchin &amp; OneWest to lie to homeowners about modifications &amp; steal homes while making millions..@SenPatRoberts says @RonWyden should take a valium? Maybe more Senators should be outraged by Wall St bankers that steal people's homes..@SenOrrinHatch said Mnuchin's bank's disgraceful actions are "essentially unrelated" to his qualifications. Tell that to his victims..@SenateDems held a forum to hear Mnuchinâ€™s victims. While watching the @USTreasury hearing, remember Colleen. https://t.co/kc8ap1VIjV.@GOPSenFinance didnâ€™t want to hear Colleen â€“ an 84-yr-old who might lose her home because of a reverse mortgage scam from Mnuchinâ€™s bank.Steve Mnuchin ran a bank that lied &amp; cheated people out of their homes. @GOPSenFinance didnâ€™t want to hear those stories today..@realDonaldTrump should stand with working Americans &amp; uphold @POTUSâ€™s protections. Read my new @CNN op-ed. https://t.co/gNozaRHTU1New protections making sure Americans are paid overtime &amp; arenâ€™t exposed to deadly chemicals could turn to dust with @realDonaldTrump.Paid sick days, a higher min wage, &amp; discrimination-free hiring for federal contractors could go out the window with @realDonaldTrump.If @realDonaldTrump follows through on promises to â€œeliminateâ€ or â€œrepealâ€ @POTUSâ€™s exec orders, workers could lose wages &amp; benefits Monday.Thank you, @SenRonJohnson. Dais or not, I hope more will watch the heartbreaking stories of Mnuchinâ€™s victims. https://t.co/RMCZNyqxsCIf Rep Tom Price wonâ€™t commit to protecting 1 in 3 Americansâ€™ health care, heâ€™s not the right person to run @HHSgov.I asked @HHSgov nominee Price: Will you follow @realDonaldTrumpâ€™s promise for no Medicare/Medicaid cuts? (Nope.) https://t.co/7pC2c4YzSl.@HHSgov nominee Tom Price proposed a whopping $449 billion in Medicare cuts &amp; $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts as chair of @housebudgetGOP..@realDonaldTrump promised over &amp; over that he wouldnâ€™t cut Medicare &amp; Medicaid, but his @HHSgov nominee won't make the same promise.OneWest Bank victims deserve to have their voices heard, so we invited them to share their stories. Tune in now: https://t.co/RMCZNyqxsCIt will take a lot more than petty rearranging of furniture to stop @SenateDems from fighting for working families, @SenateGOP.

He refused.Tune in now to watch @HELPCmteDemsâ€™s confirmation hearing with Tom Price for @HHSgov secretary: https://t.co/Xto9jqdsBSI explained my concerns about Tom Priceâ€™s @HHSgov nomination in a 20-page letter yesterday. https://t.co/edaNYEBoWOTom Price has also championed proposals to privatize Medicare &amp; radically restructure Medicaid â€“ weakening our nationâ€™s health care.Tom Price championed ACA repeal. Heâ€™s opposed improvements to womenâ€™s care. Heâ€™s cosponsored leg to discriminate against LGBT ppl.The job of @HHSgov sec is to â€œenhance &amp; protect the healthâ€¦of all Americans.â€ Iâ€™m not convinced Tom Price is willing or able to do that.If #BetsyDeVos won't use @usedgovâ€™s many tools &amp; resources to save students from fraud, she shouldn't be the Secretary of Education.Tonight I asked #BetsyDeVos a set of q's about her education experience &amp; commitment to protect students. Watch: https://t.co/0euCIOKwAnIn fact, #BetsyDeVos has no experience with student loans, Pell Grants, or public education at all.As @usedgov secretary, #BetsyDeVos would be in charge of running a $1 trillion student loan bank.

Now MA should get its fair share.Republicans also broke their promise in the #CuresAct to meaningfully boost guaranteed funding for NIH and the opioid crisis.Republicans concluded that bipartisan medical innovation in the #CuresAct would require a raft of giveaways to giant drug companies.Iâ€™m glad that many good provisions in the #CuresAct will become law, but Iâ€™m disappointed by the price we paid for the GOP to pass the bill.The #CuresAct includes my bipartisan provision reducing the admin burden at NIH to ensure more efficient spending of fed research money.The #CuresAct includes my bipartisan provision ensuring the meaningful inclusion of women &amp; minorities in clinical trials.The #CuresAct includes my bipartisan provision supporting the development of genetically-targeted therapies for people with rare diseases.The #CuresAct includes my bipartisan provision to strengthen Senator Kennedyâ€™s work to protect the genetic privacy of patients.The 21st Century #CuresAct includes a number of bipartisan provisions that Iâ€™ve spent months &amp; years working with others to write &amp; pass.So will you keep your promise to protect Medicare &amp; Medicaid, @realDonaldTrump?

Some can be an expert on anything for the right price. https://t.co/3t55RAI7r6Read this @nytimes story on how corporations fund "independent" think tank research to push their interests: https://t.co/jcAcgljYz0Big corporations must disclose lobbying expenditures, but not contributions to think tanks to fund industry-friendly studies. Thatâ€™s wrong.Want to protect open debate, Mr Koch? Disclose the spending you do to bury your opponents in an avalanche of lies: https://t.co/lF703sf4HwCharles Koch, who secretly spends millions to shred candidates and orgs he opposes, is worried that open debate is under attack. Really?!.@HouseGOP time &amp; again puts Big Oil interests over every other issue. Proud to stand w/ @MassAGO. Let her investigate &amp; see the facts.Every MA delegation member signed a letter to @LamarSmithTX21 w/ concerns about this disgraceful pander to Big Oil. https://t.co/fUl9DZ1liuGOP says @MassAGOâ€™s investigation is a war on 1st Amendment rights. But companies donâ€™t have a right to defraud their investors &amp; consumers.We haven't found another example â€“ not one â€“ of a House committee subpoenaing a STATE AG's investigation of potential STATE law violations.The @HouseGOP claims to be for statesâ€™ rights, but they donâ€™t seem to know the Constitution gives STATES power to enforce STATE law.Sci Chairman @LamarSmithTX21 issued subpoenas to @MassAGO Healey &amp; @AGSchneidermanâ€” a prime example of @HouseGOP abuse of power.The GOP-led @HouseScience Committee is helping @exxonmobil deny the reality of climate change.Today in the @NEJM I write about the need for transparency in our clinical trial system to improve people's health: https://t.co/l6hBWp53HkYesterday @MassAGO took an important step to stop the spread of lethal assault-style weapons. Read more here: https://t.co/ElPNcmPTf5Let me offer you a word of advice, @LamarSmithTX21 &amp; your @exxonmobil buddies: you picked a fight with the wrong state &amp; the wrong AG.This is an outrageous abuse of Congressional subpoena power to threaten a state AG and help a campaign contributor.For the @GOP, statesâ€™ rights only apply for restricting voting rights or regulating womenâ€™s bodies. Not investigating climate change fraud..@LamarSmithTX21 says he â€œtakes very seriously his obligation to uphold &amp; defend the Constitutionâ€ â€” but apparently not the 10th Amendment.Yup, thatâ€™s right: House Republicans are interfering with a state AGâ€™s ongoing investigation of a company violating state law.Now @exxonmobil got the Chair of the @HouseScience Committee â€” a TX Republican who has taken $675k from oil &amp; gas â€” to subpoena @MassAGO.First @exxonmobil tried to stop @MassAGO by suing Healey in a TX court &amp; attacking her integrity because sheâ€™s doing her job..@MassAGO Maura Healey is investigating whether @exxonmobil broke state laws by knowingly misleading people about climate change.Want to see how giant corporations rig the system? Look at what @exxonmobil is doing to intimidate @MassAGO to stop fraud investigation.Heartsick for the families of the Baton Rouge police officers killed today. More violence &amp; bloodshed won't fix the pain in our country.The @CFPB is proof that government CAN work for the people. #ConsumersCount https://t.co/kAUI4UG4pSWe need our gov agencies to work together to warn students, veterans &amp; families about other unlicensed â€œuniversitiesâ€ like Trump â€œU.â€11 Senate Dems &amp; I sent a letter to @usedgov, @FTC, @CFPB &amp; @DeptVetAffairs about fake schools like Trump â€œUâ€: https://t.co/HqofUVw95dTrump U violated NY law by calling itself a "university" without a charter or license. Vulnerable people lost big bucks to Trump's scheme.The @HouseGOP should be ashamed. The last thing Congress should be doing is giving homophobic Americans a license to discriminate.The GOP #FADA bill could let hospitals, government workers, employers, &amp; even landlords discriminate against married same-sex couples.Marriage equality is the law of the land. But #LGBT Americans still lack federal protections against discrimination they desperately need.Iâ€™m not joking: @HouseGOP are holding a hearing right now about making it easier for people to discriminate against #LGBT Americans.Our country has seen too many tragedies this month. So what are the @HouseGOP doing right now? Holding a hearing to legalize hate.I wish I had the answers right now to stop the very real pain that people are feeling, but I know this: change must come. It must come now.I'm sick at heart about those who would pull us apart at exactly the moment when we need to come together.Iâ€™m sick at heart for the families of the officers killed in Dallas. Sick at heart for the families of the men shot in LA &amp; MN.Black Americans shouldn't be killed in routine traffic stops, &amp; police shouldn't be killed while protecting &amp; serving their communities.No. No. No. No. No. More killing solves nothing. More grieving moms &amp; dads, sons &amp; daughters cannot bring back those weâ€™ve already  lost.#blacklivesmatter must be more than a hashtag or trending topic every time a tragedy happens. We must all come together to make it true.We can't ignore the ugly reality: black parents are terrified that teaching kids to â€œsurviveâ€ the police won't be enough. #blacklivesmatterMost cops are good ppl. But we canâ€™t ignore the ugly reality: black parents feel they must teach kids to â€œsurviveâ€ police. #blacklivesmatterWeâ€™ve seen the sickening videos of black Americans killed in traffic stops. Lives ended by those sworn to protect them. #blacklivesmatterSandra Bland. Freddie Gray. Michael Brown. Walter Scott. Tamir Rice. Eric Garner. Now Alton Sterling &amp; Philando Castile. #blacklivesmatterToday @MarkWarner, @RepCummings &amp; I sent letters to derivative clearing orgs about resolution plans if they fail. https://t.co/ly5J2cZH5VSen @MarkWarner, @RepCummings &amp; I filed a new bill today to strengthen oversight of derivatives &amp; prevent bailouts: https://t.co/cVsxjYGsnLIn just a few minutes Iâ€™ll be speaking about #antitrust policy at the @NewAmerica Open Markets program.

Consolidation &amp; concentration are on the rise.#Zika isn't just coming. It's here. If the GOP wonâ€™t take it seriously, they must accept responsibility for the devastating consequences.Every day @HouseGOP &amp; @SenateGOP don't take #Zika seriously, more ppl get sick. 481 pregnant women in US states &amp; territories have Zika NOW.Is this some sort of sick joke, @SenateGOP? Is the #Zika virus â€” and our countryâ€™s response to this emergency â€” just a game to you?!I didnâ€™t think the GOP could write 1 bill to hurt women, vets, Obamacare, PP, AND clean water all at once â€“ but they did it. #ZikaThe GOP #Zika bill cuts Senate levels of @DeptVetAffairs funding by $500M â€“ money for VA hospital maintenance &amp; raises for doctors &amp; nurses.The GOP #Zika bill rolls back Clean Water Act requirements designed to keep pesticides out of Americansâ€™ drinking water.The GOP #Zika bill blocks @PPFA from receiving birth control grant money that would help poor women with Zika avoid having deformed babies.The GOP #Zika bill guts money from healthcare exchanges in the Affordable Care Act (#obamacare) to pay for the emergency response.The GOP #Zika bill steals money from the #Ebola response fund, even though we still have 75 CDC staff on ground fighting the outbreak.The GOP #Zika bill provides $800 million less in funding than the @WhiteHouse requested. Money we need for prevention &amp; treatment.Then while @HouseDemocrats fought for gun violence votes at #NoBillNoBreak, the @HouseGOP jammed through a terrible #Zika bill at 3am.4 months ago, the @WhiteHouse requested $1.9B to fight #Zika. Dems asked the GOP to act â€“ and the GOP dragged their feet.My blood is boiling over the pathetic, dishonest &amp; malicious #Zika funding bill that @SenateMajLdr McConnell &amp; the GOP just tried to pass..@SpeakerRyan &amp; the @HouseGOP: You should be ashamed of yourselves for your totally corrupt priorities. People are watching..@HouseDemocrats: Please vote NO on this veto override. We werenâ€™t sent here to do dirty work for Wall Stâ€™s armies of lawyers &amp; lobbyists.When @SpeakerRyan turns off the cameras, the @HouseGOP gets to work â€” both for the @NRA AND for Wall Street. Unbelievable..@SpeakerRyan scheduled a vote tonight to kill a new @USDOL rule that protects workersâ€™ retirement savings from shady financial advisers.After a whole day of #NoBillNoBreak, @HouseGOP is instead moving on a vote to make it easier for retirement advisers to cheat ppl. Really.Sorry about blocking the livestream for a sec there!

Shameful. #NoBillNoBreak.@HouseDemocrats must continue to stand strong against these @GOP efforts to help Wall Street at the expense of working families.The @HouseGOP bill weakens the @CFPB, delays payday lending &amp; forced arbitration clause rules, undermines regulators &amp; cuts SEC funding.Next up on the @HouseGOPâ€™s agenda to help Wall Street: A vote on a gov funding bill chock-full of items on the big banksâ€™ wish list.After Orlando, @US_FDA should implement a risk-based blood donor policy that doesn't discriminate against LGBT men. https://t.co/ThrpkBIAEf.@ChrisMurphyCT said it right: The @SenateGOP have decided to sell weapons to ISIS.Ashamed &amp; disgusted that the Senate works for the @NRA &amp; not the majority of Americans who support basic solutions to stop gun violence.These common-sense gun reforms are THE VERY LEAST we can do to help keep our loved ones safe. #DisarmHateBack in DC &amp; ready to vote to #disarmhate by expanding background checks &amp; stopping terrorists from buying guns. https://t.co/OUWg4K1Az26 million low-wage workers are parents with kids under 18.

Watch: https://t.co/YWzxaZ9c8e #DoYourJobI wish I could say Iâ€™m surprised, but @SenateMajLdr &amp; @SenateGOP keep court seats empty as long as possible to hamstring @POTUS.I called for immediate votes on 15 judicial nominees. @SenateMajLdr objected. 9 nominees? No. 4 nominees? No. Just 1 nominee? No.I took @SenateGOP's deal: 2 other judges confirmed if Iâ€™d keep quiet. Then today I went back to the floor to call for votes on the 15.I wanted to request votes for the 15 District Court noms on Monday â€“ but @SenateMajLdr didnâ€™t want to be embarrassed so he cut me a deal.The @senjudiciary Committee has cleared 15 nominees for federal District Courts. Those nominees are still waiting for confirmation votes.Read my op-ed with @SenSchumer &amp; @SenWhitehouse opposing SS trustee nominee Blahous &amp; SEC nominee Peirce: https://t.co/lSAUyjR88YThe Kochsâ€™ purpose is clear: To tilt the game further for corporate special interests. Itâ€™s up to us to fight back.The Koch Brothers are dumping enormous resources into grooming &amp; bankrolling anti-gov zealots for top gov positions.A marriage between @realDonaldTrumpâ€™s toxic racism &amp; @RepHensarlingâ€™s Wall Street giveaways is a path to ruin for our country.In fact, @RepHensarling met with @realDonaldTrump today to pitch him on his new plan to gut Wall St reform â€“ including the @CFPB.Today in the Banking Committee I spoke about @RepHensarlingâ€™s new bill I call the Wet Kiss for Wall Street Act. https://t.co/qCTweAI770.@SenateGOP: Have a hearing and a vote on #SCOTUS nominee Merrick Garland. Ditch the extremism and #DoYourJob.The GOP says if gov isnâ€™t working for them &amp; their rich buddies, they wonâ€™t let it work for anyone. That extremism got us @realDonaldTrump..@SenateGOP obstruct @POTUS's nominees just because they donâ€™t like the guy doing the nominating. Read my report: https://t.co/MfZfye5qVMGov is supposed to work for all of us. But when it comes to making sure courts &amp; watchdogs are staffed, @SenateGOP refuse to do their jobs.Congress wasnâ€™t elected to help predatory lenders. If anyone tries to block or delay the @CFPB payday rules, itâ€™s time to fight back hard.Payday lending is a $7B/yr industry. That buys a lot of influence in Congress â€“ not just with the GOP, but also some Democrats.The proposed payday lending rule isnâ€™t perfect â€“ it could do more â€“ but the payday industry is already firing back.The @CFPBâ€™s new rule cracks down on tricks payday lenders use to generate thousands in interest &amp; fees from ppl trapped in cycles of debt.Itâ€™s another good day: The @CFPB just took a big step to protect consumers from predatory payday loans. https://t.co/KtnxEk4F1EWeâ€™ll gear up &amp; fight back, like weâ€™ve done so many times before. We wonâ€™t let the @CFPB be destroyed by Wall St &amp; their Washington friends.The @CFPB has handled 900k complaints &amp; forced big banks to return $11B to people they cheated. @HouseGOP canâ€™t stand gov that works..@HouseAppropsGOP voted today to hamstring the @CFPB &amp; make it tougher for the cops on Wall Street to do their jobs.Student loans make it tough for ppl to buy homes.

Today @USDOL released an overtime pay rule that helps make that happen.#Zika is coming, &amp; if the @SenateGOP blocks Congress from protecting people, they must accept responsibility for devastating consequences.We cannot nickel-and-dime the #Zika health emergency response.

We would be foolish to ignore their warnings.This is a giant warning sign of the central role big banks will play in the next crisis unless Congress &amp; regulators show some backbone.No execs lost their jobs in exchange for taxpayer rescue. None went to jail. Some, like Jamie Dimon, are still running the same banks.Big bank execs got rich but when it all predictably blew up, the gov lavished their institutions with billions in bailouts.The big banks spread risk throughout the system by misleading investors about the quality of mortgages in the securities they were offering.There would be no crisis without these giant banks that encouraged reckless mortgage lending &amp; funded slimy subprime lenders.Wall St lobbyists have tried to deflect blame for the 2008 crisis for years. But their revisionist history is untrue &amp; dangerous.Unless the banks promptly address regulatorsâ€™ concerns, the gov must push these banks to get smaller &amp; less complex.5 US banks are big enough that any one could crash the economy again if they failed &amp; werenâ€™t bailed out. Itâ€™s a very big deal. Itâ€™s scary.Today, after an extensive review, fed regulators concluded that 5 of the biggest banks are still Too Big to Fail. https://t.co/zZNeA8HjrNThe Tax Filing Simplification Act is a commonsense bill to push the IRS to simplify Tax Day. Learn more: https://t.co/knv4GUBu8GAnd the Tax Filing Simplification Act provides a return-free option for those with simple tax situations.The Tax Filing Simplification Act lets taxpayers download third-party-reported tax information that the IRS already has.It prohibits the IRS from entering into agreements w/ tax prep companies that restrict its ability to provide free online services.My bill directs the IRS to develop a free, online tax prep &amp; filing service that taxpayers can use directly w/ the gov.Today I introduced the Tax Filing Simplification Act to help taxpayers file with less stress &amp; fewer costs.Congress should be making it easier for Americans to file their taxes, not bowing to the interests of the tax prep industry.This year, taxpayers will spend an average of 13 hrs prepping taxes &amp; pay $200 for tax prep services.Read my officeâ€™s new report on how the IRS caved to powerful companies w/ a vested interest in complicated taxes: https://t.co/wXXrLh60T7That means taxpayers have to spend billions â€“ and share personal info with 3rd-parties â€“ just to file taxes.The tax prep industry has fought zealously to block the IRS from implementing laws to make tax prep &amp; filing easier.We recognize #EqualPayDay - &amp; we fight so we donâ€™t have to recognize it again. Watch: https://t.co/1zwmmY1oFp#EqualPayDay isnâ€™t a national day of celebration. Itâ€™s a national day of embarrassment.I cannot believe weâ€™re still standing here debating whether a woman should get fired for asking what the guy down the hall makes.Today is #EqualPayDay â€“ and I cannot believe I have to give another speech fighting for equal pay for equal work for women.Friday is #OneBostonDay.

Watch: https://t.co/UERGA0cdbbThe bipartisan Financial Crisis Inquiry Comm said this "pivotal failure" was a "prime example" of how regulators let the meltdown happen.One witness had led the Fed division that refused to regulate deceptive mortgages, including subprime lending that helped spark the crisis..@BankingGOP held a hearing today to talk about why we should roll back rules on mortgages &amp; credit cards because theyâ€™re just too costly.Everyone who is serious about standing up for borrowers with #studentdebt should embrace these fundamentals. Watch: https://t.co/UCbEQsl2ImIâ€™ve laid out 5 simple reform fundamentals for @usedgovâ€™s student loan program to clean up its act. #studentdebt https://t.co/3RAZJRlLCQItâ€™s past time for @usedgovâ€™s bank to start running the student loan program to benefit students, not companies like Navient. #studentdebtInstead of holding Navient accountable, @usedgovâ€™s student loan bank covered for them. Outrageous, but not surprising. #studentdebtNavient, one of the biggest student loan servicers, got caught cheating American soldiers on student loans. #studentdebtOur DC staff members are safe, &amp; we are all very grateful for the Capitol Police &amp; their heroic work to protect us today &amp; every day.#ff to my friend @SenFranken, who has a brand-new office Twitter account.

Itâ€™s time for the Senate to do its job. #SCOTUSnomineeAlong the way, heâ€™s won praise from Dem &amp; GOP Senators, liberals &amp; conservatives â€“ even the SCOTUS Chief Justice. #SCOTUSnomineeJudge Merrick Garland has served his country with distinction â€“ as a prosecutor, DOJ official, &amp; DC Circuit judge. #SCOTUSnomineeI joined colleagues &amp; Hamilton's @Lin_Manuel to urge action so #PuertoRico can restructure its debt. #PRDayofAction https://t.co/czvfYet8ZLIf PR were a country, it could go to the IMF.

If @Senate_GOPs want to stand up to extremist candidates, they can start by standing up to extremists in the Senate..@Senate_GOPs want to play it both ways: rejecting @POTUSâ€™s legitimacy and crippling the govt while claiming Rs can govern responsibly.At the same time theyâ€™re blocking any SCOTUS nominee, @Senate_GOPs are in a panic that their party will nominate an extremist for President.Glad to intro @RepJoeKennedy's bill in the Sen to strengthen accountability &amp; give consumers better tools for info.  https://t.co/oIYolosPr9Another sign the bipartisan chorus is growing to make sure Wall Street fund managers pay their fair share: https://t.co/J6sRgItlaiRead my new @TalkPoverty op-ed on why we need the #SAVEBenefits Act to give seniors &amp; vets a SS raise: https://t.co/TZsHxz9LiQAny conversation about tackling poverty in the US should include protecting &amp; expanding Social Security.The @CFPB should move soon &amp; robustly on its new rules for payday lenders. No delays, and no carve-outs.The @CFPB is doing a great job to crack down on the tricks &amp; traps in payday loans. Congress should back the @CFPB, not sabotage it.Until the @CFPB, no federal agency was responsible for overseeing payday lenders, who can stick vulnerable people with rates up to 400%.2.5 million households borrow from payday lenders each year, with more storefronts in the US than McDonaldâ€™s and Starbucks combined.FMLA was a huge step fwd, and we must do more. Read my @BostonGlobe op-ed on how to level the playing field: https://t.co/uRk48gJvkMWe need real agency reform to level the playing field - not to give lobbyists more chances to block outcomes they donâ€™t like.Read my letter to @CTFC Commissioner Giancarlo, calling on him to withdraw this report: https://t.co/naYfAuGNBZThe @CFTC committeeâ€™s report is little more than a recitation of industry talking points and should be treated as such.The @CFTC report is riddled w/ problems &amp; mischaracterizations, &amp; adopted without public discussion or public vote.The advisory committee behind this compromised @CFTC report consists almost entire of industry insiders â€“ violating Dodd-Frank.Today that advisory committee presented a final report that is critical of the @CFTCâ€™s proposed rule on commodities futures &amp; swaps.Under Dodd-Frank, Congress directed the @CFTC to establish the EEMAC â€“ an advisory committee for diverse views on CFTC actions.Today I joined the @SenateDems at the Supreme Court to tell the GOP: #DoYourJob on a #SCOTUS nominee. https://t.co/hVjX9KfnYjMedical experts agree: Whatever you think of medical marijuana, it's  irresponsible not to study the science:  https://t.co/VTgRzoLmOrSerious medical research on medical marijuana is largely blocked by outdated federal laws &amp; policies.Medical marijuana might be a viable alternative to opioids for pain treatment, but truthfully, there's a lot we just don't know.Partial fill policies for opioids can help reduce the number of unused pills in circulation. Watch: https://t.co/ieQoVyTMJx #partialfillbillWishing my very best for a speedy recovery to one of the Senateâ€™s toughest fighters, @clairecmc. The whole Twitterverse is here for you!Abandoning their Senate duties would also prove that all the Republican talk about loving the Constitution is just that â€“ empty talk.The Senate GOP took an oath just like Dems did. Abandoning the duties they swore to uphold threatens the Constitution &amp; our democracy.I canâ€™t find a clause in the Constitution that says â€œâ€¦except when thereâ€™s a year left in the term of a Democratic President.â€Art II Sec 2 of the Constitution says the President nominates Supreme Court justices with the advice &amp; consent of the Senate..@SenateMajLdr is right that Americans should have a voice in selecting the next SCOTUS justice. In fact, they did: when @POTUS won in 2012.The sudden death of Justice Scalia creates an immediate vacancy on the most important court in the United States..@RepCummings &amp; I sent a letter to @USDOL about advisorsâ€™ wildly conflicting messages on a conflict of interest rule https://t.co/U7y9ZoFrxiBut when these retirement advisors talk to their own stockholders, the doomsday predictions disappear &amp; the companies say theyâ€™ll be fine.Financial companies have predicted dire consequences from a new rule requiring them to act in customersâ€™ best interests.I won't support more "innovation" proposals until we have a bipartisan agreement to strengthen @US_FDA &amp; seriously fund medical research.Watch my remarks to the HELP Committee today on why Congress needs to commit to funding medical research: https://t.co/mq25Z1DOAXHeading into an election, it'd be easy for Congress to pass some small bills, declare victory &amp; quit. But that's not good enough.Last yr, @newtgingrich said ignoring this NIH funding problem â€œtakes a special kind of stupidity that is reserved for this city.â€ I agree.Big medical breakthroughs come from basic research. Instead of funding that research, Congress has spent a decade choking off support.The Senate HELP Committee approved bills today to advance US medical innovation. I voted for those bills - but it isn't enough.On #FMLA23, we remember how much more we need to do to level the playing field for workers &amp; families. https://t.co/JRqeMniImEOn #GoRedForWomen Day, Iâ€™m fighting to double NIH funding to help millions of women live longer, healthier lives. https://t.co/EoYuUTo0ZlIf we want strong enforcement, personnel is policy. Read Commissioner Bowenâ€™s call for tougher Wall St enforcement: https://t.co/sm3QxIsEFAEvery single House Republican who came to work today just voted to make it harder to hold big banks accountable for fraud. Shameful.Tell Congress: They work for the American people â€” not Wall Street banks that break the law. Vote NO on HR 766.You read that right: The House is just minutes away from voting on a bill to make it tougher to investigate &amp; prosecute bank fraud.Nope â€” right now on the House floor, Wall St buddies are pushing a bill to make it tougher to prosecute bank fraud.Youâ€™d think big banks would be happy with enforcement so tepid that they could just bake fines into the cost of doing business, right?Systematic fraud on Wall St helped spark the 2008 financial crisis â€“ but not a single Wall St executive went to jail.If anyone in Congress thinks they can make it harder to crack down on corporate criminals, I promise you: The American people are watching.Today I spoke on the Senate floor about our rigged justice system for the rich &amp; powerful. Watch: https://t.co/NWX8Et2hqAThe American people remember who broke our economy &amp; who made out like bandits â€“ and they didnâ€™t send us here to help the bandits.Want to see the rigged game in action? Tomorrow, the House will vote on a GOP bill to make it harder to investigate &amp; prosecute bank fraud.Itâ€™s not equal justice when a kid gets thrown in jail for stealing a car, while a CEO gets a huge raise when his company steals billions.We have one set of law on the books, but two legal systems: One for the rich &amp; powerful, and one for everyone else.Heading to the Senate floor now to discuss my enforcement report &amp; GOP efforts to weaken Wall St accountability: https://t.co/fbMGC9EVjRToday I urged Congress to reject the #TPP deal before it makes things even worse for Americaâ€™s families: https://t.co/h339ZKInfyCongress will have to vote straight up or down on #TPP.  We wonâ€™t have a chance to strip out any of the worst provisions, like ISDS.A rigged process produces a rigged outcome. Evidence of this tilt can be seen in a key #TPP provision: ISDS.12 countries will sign the #TPP trade deal on Thursday - but it won't go into effect unless Congress approves it.Today I asked the Senate GOP: If you won't support #InTheRed, then what's your plan for student loan debt? https://t.co/kIjPpgSgRyThanks everyone for coming to our Springfield open house today! I'm happy to fight for Western MA in the Senate. https://t.co/g90P757ZaGThe next president can honor the simple notion that nobody is above the law, but it will happen only if voters demand it.Read my new @nytimes op-ed about how personnel is policy for enforcing federal laws: https://t.co/BZZSpjm7VSToday my office released a report on 20 of the worst federal enforcement failures in 2015: https://t.co/u0R2JX1BNdPresidents donâ€™t control most day-to-day enforcement decisions, but they do nominate heads of agencies. That makes all the difference.Much of the attention on DC focuses on enacting laws, but a law that's not enforced may as well not even be a law at all.2016 candidates are pitching their legislative agendas, but voters should consider what presidents can do without Congress.Today we remember Framinghamâ€™s Christa McAuliffe &amp; the astronauts we lost 30 yrs ago on #Challenger: https://t.co/6qRkgUhEFGI donâ€™t love Wall St bankers who break our economy â€“ but I LOVED #TheBigShort. Great to meet @GhostPanther today! https://t.co/l8cNe1gZ17Yesterday, @SenateDems announced our new #InTheRed campaign to help students getting crushed with debt. https://t.co/kQ2zexKehNThis Congress doesnâ€™t lack workable ideas for how to root out the influence of money in politics; it just lacks the spine to do them.Hereâ€™s a whole list of things Congress could do if we had the courage to stand up to the super-wealthy few: https://t.co/xjGe3EzdgAWe can â€“ and we should â€“ blame the Supreme Court for #CitizensUnited. But that is no excuse for doing nothing.Money floods our political system, letting a handful of billionaires shape who gets into Congress &amp; may decide who sits in the White House.Six years ago today, #CitizensUnited turned loose a flood of hidden money that is about to drown our democracy.Consumers need a central place to turn to for help when they are denied coverage for mental health care.
