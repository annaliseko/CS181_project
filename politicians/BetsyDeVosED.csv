It‚Äôs this kind of local control that we want to empower.
"Now parents are in direct control. The community takes ownership of developing the School 15‚Äôs structure, staffing and performance."

No parent should feel like @USEDGOV thinks it knows better than they what is best for their child.
No teacher in any classroom should feel like @USEDGOV is holding them back from success with their kids.
"This isn't right, nor is it acceptable. Under this Administration, we will break this habit."

"#ESSA requires states to ensure ALL students have access to excellent teachers &amp; a positive, safe learning environment... (1/2)"
#ESSA provides states the latitude to do what‚Äôs best for children while preserving important civil rights protections.
#ESSA ensures transparency and accountability provisions for all schools.
"We‚Äôre doing what‚Äôs best for children by implementing #ESSA as Congress intended, w/ the freedom &amp; flexibility state &amp; local leaders deserve."
The underlying principles of #ESSA are built on that same trust.
"My philosophy is simple: I trust parents, I trust teachers and I trust local school leaders to do what‚Äôs right for the children they serve."
"I support great public schools &amp; I support great public school teachers, because I support students ‚Äì ALL students."
"If a child is able to grow and flourish, it shouldn‚Äôt matter where they learn."
"In too many cities and states, parents are still denied the simple but critical choice of what school their child attends."
"When parents are empowered to take charge of their children's education, when they have quality options, we see better results for students."
Parents know better than any politician or administrator the unique needs of each of their children.
I‚Äôve seen the changes in a community when it chooses to come together and invest in the rising generation.
"My heart has leapt to see big smiles on the faces of kids who are in a school that welcomes, challenges &amp; embraces them for who they are."
I got involved in education because I saw firsthand how many children &amp; parents struggled to find a school that met their needs.

#HBCUs remain at the forefront of opening doors that had previously been closed to so many.

"I consider protecting all students, including #LGBTQ students, not only a key priority for the Department, but for every school in America."
"Schools, communities, and families can find ‚Äì and in many cases have found ‚Äì solutions that protect all students."
A federal court in August 2016 issued a nationwide injunction barring the Department from enforcing a portion of the previous guidance.
"This is not merely a federal mandate, but a moral obligation no individual, school, district or state can abdicate."
